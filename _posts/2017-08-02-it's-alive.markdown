It's up, finally! I have gotten `jeykll` up and running with some custom css. Being new to using Linux it was a learning experience, that's for sure.

Of course this is a work in progress and I will be doing design changes here and there.

Future plans include:
* `Projects page`
* `Sidebar`
* `Tags`
* `Comments`


As I dive deeper into development and if all goes well, I will be updating this blog as I learn and complete projects.

*So bookmark me now....* You don't want to miss what's to come. Starting with a break down on how I set up Jekyll and this blog.
